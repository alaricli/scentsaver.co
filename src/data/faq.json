      "question": "What Is a decant?",
      "answer": {
        "text": "A fragrance decant is a smaller, hand-filled bottle of perfume that is taken from a full-size, original bottle. Unlike samples that are often provided by perfume brands, decants are typically not produced by the brand itself but are instead carefully transferred into smaller, travel-friendly atomizers by a trusted seller. This allows you to try a scent in a larger quantity than a sample without committing to a full bottle. Decants are a great way to explore a wide variety of fragrances or carry your favorite scents on the go!"

      "question": "What Is the Decanting Process Like?",
      "answer": {
        "text": "The decanting process involves carefully transferring a fragrance from its original full-size bottle into a smaller, high-quality atomizer. We use sterile equipment and clean, air-tight containers to ensure that the fragrance maintains its integrity throughout the process. Each decant is filled to order in a clean environment to prevent any contamination or loss of scent quality. This way, you get a fresh portion of the fragrance, making it easy to try different scents without purchasing a full bottle."

      "question": "What Is the Difference Between a Decant and a Sample?",
      "answer": {
        "text": "The key difference between a decant and a sample lies in how they are packaged and the quantity of fragrance they contain. A sample is usually a small vial provided directly by the fragrance brand, typically around 1-2ml, and is meant for a quick test of the scent. A decant, on the other hand, is a larger portion of the original fragrance that we hand-fill into a travel-sized atomizer. Our decants usually range from 2ml to 10ml, giving you more product to enjoy before deciding if you want to invest in a full-size bottle. Decants are great for those who want to experience a fragrance over several wears or take their favorite scent on the go."

    {
      "question": "How Long Will a Decant Last?",
      "answer": {
        "text": "The longevity of a decant depends on its size and how often you use it. For example, a 2ml decant can provide approximately 20-25 sprays, while a 10ml decant offers around 100-125 sprays. If you use 2-3 sprays each time, a 2ml decant can last around 1-2 weeks of daily wear, while a 10ml decant could last over a month. Decants are perfect for those who want to try a fragrance for an extended period before committing to a larger bottle. To ensure your decant lasts as long as possible, store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight."
